      <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Diwash Niroula</strong>, a Computer Programming student at Georgian College. I’m passionate about building efficient, user-friendly applications and continuously expanding my technical skills. I have experience with core programming languages like <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong>CSS</strong>, and I enjoy using them to bring creative ideas to life.</p>
