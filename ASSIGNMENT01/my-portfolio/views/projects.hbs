            <p>
              My Smart Door Lock System is a microcontroller-based security solution built in Tinkercad using an Arduino board, keypad, and servo motor. It was designed to simulate a secure entry mechanism for doors, ideal for homes or workplaces.
            </p>

            <p>
              The system is programmed to accept a <strong>6-digit passcode</strong>. When the correct passcode is entered, the servo motor rotates to unlock the door. If an incorrect passcode is entered, the system remains locked and provides visual feedback through a serial monitor or LCD.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a security feature, the system includes a fail-safe mechanism. After <strong>5 consecutive incorrect attempts</strong>, the lock system becomes disabled, requiring a physical key or reset to regain access. This functionality simulates a real-world lockout scenario in case of tampering or brute-force attempts.
            </p>

            <p>
              This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of embedded logic, conditional programming, and hardware simulation in a hands-on environment. It demonstrates how I integrate coding with real-world applications to build practical and secure systems.
